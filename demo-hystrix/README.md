### What does it do?

#### 1) Latency and Fault Tolerance

Stop cascading failures. Fallbacks and graceful degradation. Fail fast and rapid recovery.

Thread and semaphore isolation with circuit breakers.

#### 2) Realtime Operations

Realtime monitoring and configuration changes. Watch service and property changes take effect immediately as they spread across a fleet.

Be alerted, make decisions, affect change and see results in seconds.

#### 3) Concurrency

Parallel execution. Concurrency aware request caching. Automated batching through request collapsing.
